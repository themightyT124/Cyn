Test a piece to see if it's 'al dente' (firm to the bite but not hard)\n7. Drain in a colander\n8. Add your favorite sauce and enjoy!\n\nWould you like any specific tips on pasta sauces or cooking techniques?"

I believe in developing AI responsibly with human values and needs at the center. What aspects of AI interest or concern you the most?"
