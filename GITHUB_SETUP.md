# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps to create and set up your GitHub repository for the AI Voice Transformation Platform.

## 1. Create a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "ai-voice-transformation")
4. Add a description: "A cutting-edge AI voice transformation platform specializing in character-specific voice cloning and personalization"
5. Choose "Public" or "Private" visibility based on your preference
6. Check "Add a README file"
7. Add a .gitignore template for Node
8. Choose an open-source license (MIT is recommended)
9. Click "Create repository"

## 2. Clone the Repository Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-voice-transformation.git
cd ai-voice-transformation
```

## 3. Add Project Files

Copy all project files from this Replit to your local repository:

1. Use the Replit "Download as zip" feature, or
2. Manually transfer files to your local repository folder

## 4. Push to GitHub

```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: AI Voice Transformation Platform"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## 5. Set Up GitHub Pages (Optional)

If you want to deploy the frontend to GitHub Pages:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Go to "Settings" > "Pages"
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
4. Choose the "Static HTML" workflow
5. Commit the workflow file to your repository

## 6. Set Up GitHub Actions

The CI workflow is already included in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. This will:

1. Run on every push to main/master and on pull requests
2. Set up Node.js environments for testing
3. Install dependencies and build the project
4. Create necessary directories
5. Run basic tests

## 7. Add GitHub Repository Settings

You may want to customize your repository with the following settings:

1. **Branches Protection**:
   - Go to Settings > Branches
   - Add rule for the main branch requiring pull request reviews

2. **Security Alerts**:
   - Enable Dependabot alerts and security updates
   - Enable code scanning with GitHub CodeQL

3. **Collaborators**:
   - Invite team members to collaborate on the project

## 8. Update Repository Links

Make sure to update all repository links in documentation to point to your actual GitHub repository URL.
